      <p class="bio"><strong>I am a recent MEng Civil Engineering graduate with a strong passion for software,
          relevant training in programming languages like Swift 5 & Python 3 plus experience in iOS app development.
          I have interests that span across computer science and engineering, such as software engineering, data science, web dev, and machine learning.
          I also have a great passion for finance and the stock market, doing my own research and investing my own savings on the side. 
          I am always hungry to learn more. </p>

          <h3>Technical and Programming Skills</h3>
          <p>For someone who, since a young age, has been incredibly talented at mathematics having taken Maths,
            Further Maths, and Physics at A Level before going onto become a Master of Engineering at Newcastle University,
            programming and computer science seemed like a natural next step in my development.
            Over the past 18 months I have aquired an immense passion for building digital products such as iOS apps,
            websites (such as this one), Python Notebooks (more details in the Finance and Investing section below), and web applications in Python.</p>
          <h4>DJ Music Discovery iOS App - Swift 5.3</h4>
          <p>One example of an iOS app I designed and wrote is a music discovery app for DJs. The app alowed users to pick a start and end chord
            and the app would then display sections of songs with that chord progression so a DJ could fit it in their mix.
            The user could then preview the song by tapping on the search result:</p>
          <img class="demo-image" src="images/DJ App Demo.001.jpeg" alt="App Demo image">
          <p>The user can also save songs to their favourites.
            I used CoreData to save 'Song' objects with Object Orientated Programming:</p>
          <img class="demo-image" src="images/DJ App Demo 2.001.jpeg" alt="App Demo image 2">
          <p>Users were also able to signup to an account with password protection,
            I used the Google Firebase framework to achieve this:</p>
          <img class="demo-image" src="images/DJ App Demo 3.001.jpeg" alt="App Demo image 3">
          <p>This was an important project for me because it taught me a lot, not only about iOS development,
            but about computer science in general such as memory management, multithreading, and security.
            This has since inspiried me to take computer science courses online from Harvard University's CS50 and on sites like Brilliant.org.
            I found I had a great hunger to keep learning more and more about topics like cryptography (love this because of the maths involved),
            binary code, AI and machine learning, data science, artifical neural networks and a lot more!</p>

          <h3>Finance and Investing</h3>
          <p>Ever since I turned 18 and it became legal for me to open a trading account with a broker nearly 7 years ago I have been obessed with investing in the stock market.
            I learnt a lot about both techincal and fundamental analysis for stock selection
            from reading books on the topic as well as how to analyse financial data using Python Notebooks:
            <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1GH8z0bkOaW5H_UuoZwuN0MxViwdBLr7b?usp=sharing">Efficient Frontier for Portfilio Optimisation</a></p>
          <p>And another notebook for implementing Warren Buffett's strategies for stock selection:
            <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zJtJrJNKT25RUcDXfMLV-ouvj1QmPRdR?usp=sharing">Buffettology</a></p>
          <p>Getting a read on the markets has always fascinated me,
            I actively watch Bloomberg News rather than regular news as I feel that the markets paint a better picture for what is going on in the world.
            Bullish or bearish sentiment helps me get a more genuine understanding for the general outlook than a news anchor reading headlines.
            Plus, I believe that having a good economic education is absolutely essential for understanding the world around you,
            so I want to be on my A game when it comes to understanding the economy. </p>

          <h3>Extracurricular Activities</h3>
          <h4>TEDx Talk - The Future for Smart Cities and the Internet of Things</h4>
          <p>To challenge myself and step outside my comfront zone I decided to write and prefrom a 10 minute talk for TEDx.
            I gained confidence when public speaking which is usually something I don't often have to do but I beileve is a valuable skill to have.</p>

          <h4>Helped develop User Stories for 'Dabbl' a real world investment app</h4>
          <p>Made key suggestions to help improve ‘user stories’ for both new and existing users of Dabbl getting them to invest with the app.
            And designed methods for testing hypotheses for user behaviour.</p>

          <h4>Building Machine Learning Python Notebooks with Tensorflow</h4>
          <p>I am fascinated by AI and machine learning. I was inspiried to take a Udemy course on the topic of
            machine learning using Tensorflow with the hopes that one day I will be able to apply it to my stock market analysis.
            Here is a few Colab notebooks I have written using Tensorflow:</p>
